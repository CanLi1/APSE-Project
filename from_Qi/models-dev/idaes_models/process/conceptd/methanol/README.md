## Methanol Process
This is an in-development model and logic-based outer-approximation solution implementation for the Methanol process detailed in [Metin Turkay's 1996 paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0098-1354(95)00219-7).

This model is in active development, so expect many large revisions to organization and function.

The subdirectories are:
* depr - containing depreciated code modules that may still be useful at some point
* gams - containing Metin's original GAMS code as well as my first abortive attempt at a port to Pyomo
* poc - various proof of concept demonstrations for myself
* test - various unit tests for different model elements
